            <p>
              <strong>High-performance organizations</strong> (teams) aren’t lucky accidents. They're developed and led by <colored-cs>c</colored-cs>ompetent, <colored-cs>c</colored-cs>onfident and <colored-cs>c</colored-cs>onsistent <strong>high-performance leaders.</strong> These leaders understand that a powerful strategy and structure are necessary yet <em>insufficient</em> without an appropriate / healthy <colored-cs>c</colored-cs>ulture.
            </p>
            
            <p>
			    <!-- ======= Possibly use as first paragraph instead of 2nd ======= -->
              <strong>Leadership</strong> is taking people places they wouldn’t go on their own. Leadership is getting people to achieve and do what they wouldn’t achieve and do on their own. The keys to effective leadership are the practice of self-awareness, empathy, trust, and <colored-cs>c</colored-cs>ontinuous learning, and impactful <colored-cs>c</colored-cs>ommunication. Effective leaders are fueled by an inner drive that’s visible from the demonstration of their authentic <colored-cs>c</colored-cs>ommitment. That <colored-cs>c</colored-cs>ommitment gets channeled through their skillful utilization of <colored-cs>c</colored-cs>andor, <colored-cs>c</colored-cs>ourage, <colored-cs>c</colored-cs>ommunication, and <colored-cs>c</colored-cs>ollaboration.
            </p>
			
			<p><strong>Leaders are positive influencers. <em>Leaders trade in trust.</em> They know trust is the primary <colored-cs>c</colored-cs>urrency for effective relationships.</strong> Trust is enhanced through <colored-cs>c</colored-cs>onnection, inspiration, personal and organizational alignment. Trust overcomes fear, defensiveness, cynicism, and apathy -- the factors that destroy hope, meaningful action, and empowered execution.</p>

			<p>
			<strong>Leaders</strong> model the way, encourage the heart and inspire people to leave their <colored-cs>c</colored-cs>omfort zones for something potentially better, bigger and bolder. Leaders <colored-cs>c</colored-cs>reate the <colored-cs>c</colored-cs>onditions for people to <em>find a way or make a way</em> to deliver results that make the difference. 
			<!-- Leaders know that to be effective they need to set the agenda with a clear and compelling mission and support it with an effective strategy, structure, and culture (and operate in a way that reflects that strategy always trumps structure  and culture).

              <h4>Mindset before skillset to have the best chance at execution</h4>
              <p>Mindset is analogous to the operating system on your computer. It simultaneously enables the capabilities (what's possible) in applications and also limits what's possible. Mindset works the same way. Your mindset enables everything that you can achieve and do, and simultaneously, your mindset limits what you can do. 
			  We deliver highly customized learning and development processes that change behavior for more consistent execution of your best practices.

One year later, our sales per call where sixty percent higher than the national average and forty percent higher than the next best performing team.

			  <strong>Client B: </strong>Added $33.5 million to the top line with the same headcount while the industry was flat. Increased the stick rate by 17% and had the highest service quality ratings in the history of the organization. </br>
			  <strong>Client C:</strong> Went from 68,000 confirmed sales in the baseline year to 149,000 confirmed sales with the same headcount  </br>
			   <strong>Client D:</strong> A new hire pilot group outsold the team average (the experienced sales team) by 10.1%. They did this in week 3 of their 5-week new hire program. </br>
<strong>Client E:</strong> Simultaneously decreased employee attrition by 6% while increasing employee sales productivity by 13%. </br>
<strong>Client F:</strong> Approximately 90 days after launch, the client measured that the users of our system were averaging $76,000 more in sales than the non-users. </br>

Client G: Measured a 20% increase in sales in the pilot group over the control group

					Gregg has an uncanny ability to see beyond the current situation. Gregg just seems to always understand what is at stake and deliver his message in a powerful way that seems to resonate with everyone in the room.
					I have had the pleasure of working with Gregg on several occasions, and each time I had the distinct impression that he raised the bar and yet I always felt more inclined to believe that we would reach our goals.
					Gregg is an outstanding leader and has been a great business partner.
